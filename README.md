# DeepHAR: CNN & BiLSTM Based Human Activity Recognition

This repository presents **DeepHAR**, a comprehensive comparison of **classical machine learning** and **deep learning** approaches for **Human Activity Recognition (HAR)** using the **UCI HAR Dataset**. The dataset contains smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope time-series signals from 30 participants performing six daily activities.

DeepHAR implements:
* Random Forest
* SVM
* XGBoost
* 1D CNN
* BiLSTM

The **1D CNN achieves the highest accuracy**, demonstrating the strength of deep temporal feature extraction.

##  CNN1D Architecture

The CNN1D architecture used in this project consists of:

* **Conv1D (kernel size = 3) → ReLU**
* **MaxPooling1D (pool size = 2)**
* **Conv1D + Dropout(0.5)**
* **Flatten**
* **Dense + Softmax (6 activity classes)**

This lightweight architecture effectively captures temporal patterns in sensor data.
